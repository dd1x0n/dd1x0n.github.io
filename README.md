This project was built for the May 2020 Code Louisville Front End final class project. This project uses a handful of CSS and Javascript techniques that control the behavior of the photos shot and their interaction with the scrolling texts. 

All photos were taken in and around La Paz, Bolivia in 2018 on expired Color Fujifilm 400 film. 

I have holding on these photos waiting for a time show them off and water better way than their own dedicated site! 

#Fulfilled Optional Requirements
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu
	
	A hamburger menu w/ a Nav bar adjusting as the screen resizes.

- Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format
	
	By use of my Sign-Up page this requirement is satisfied. 

	It uses a series of Javascript arguments to ensure First /Last name and email address are properly typed.

- Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)

	This is used in the CSS for the transformation and fad out of the image carosel. 

- Create an image carousel with at least 3 images that it rotates through

	There is an image caorsel the is used on the Sign-Up page. that uses 5 images impoted from a free image website.

- Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific 

	I was going for something akin to a "wipe" technique commonly used in motion pictures. Modern CSS made this significantly easier to accomplish with use of transform and webkit additions. 

	This project uses a handful of CSS techniques that control the behavior of the photos shot and their interaction with the scrolling texts.

	Originally there was going to be a persistent border that framed the images but that was removed early on in order to simplify the project. 
#Additinal Requirements
- Nav bar resizes and transforms into drop down menu when in mobile view. Additionally, the background image multiplies as if one was looking at a fill roll.

- Javascrip is on a different file and is used to validate sign-up form.
- Comments are throught the HTML, CSS & JS files.
