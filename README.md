This project was built for the May 2020 Code Louisville Front End final class project. This project uses a handful of CSS and Javascript techniques that control the behavior of the photos shot and their interaction with the scrolling texts. 

All photos were taken in and around La Paz, Bolivia in 2018 on expired Color Fujifilm 400 film. 

I have holding on these photos waiting for a time show them off and water better way than their own dedicated site! 

#Fulfilled Requirements

- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu
	
	While not a hamburger menu, the Nav bar does adjust as screen size decreases. It also auto hides in order to not impede viewing on any device. 

- Create a form that takes in at least two fields of information and validates input (for example, it checks to ensure email is the a@b.com format
	
	By use of my Sign-Up page this requirement is satisfied. 

	It uses a series of Javascript arguments to ensure First /Last name and email address are properly typed.

- Use “:nth child” CSS to style a series of elements (for example, change the color of every 2nd item in a list)

	This was used in my Nav Bar to change the colors of the different links. 

- Other features can be added to this list - just ask if your project needs something specific 

	I was going for something akin to a "wipe" technique commonly used in motion pictures. Modern CSS made this significantly easier to accomplish with use of transform and webkit additions. 

	This project uses a handful of CSS techniques that control the behavior of the photos shot and their interaction with the scrolling texts.

	Originally there was going to be a persistent border that framed the images but that was removed early on in order to simplify the project.
