    <h3 class="words"> There is something truly unique about film. The finality of the medium over digital photography adds an element of permanence to the simple act of taking a photo.
      What follows are a series of landscapes,  focusing on decay,  isolation and abandonment made all the more real by the obsolete medium that captured it. Above is a photo from the room where I stayed during my time in Jupapina, Bolivia. At the crest of the mountain is Muela Del Diablo.

    <h3 class="words">Shot on a disposable camera in around Bolivia in the Summer of 2018, the film inside expired sometime in the early 2000s which I felt would almost transport one back in time. Above is a Jeep that I found while exploring Coroico. A local informed me that his grandfather parked it there sometime in the early 1980s. </h3>

    <h3 class="words">One of the most enjoyable things while shooting on expired film was not knowing if it would even work. This camera had been tucked away in a drawer in a office, forgotten, rendered obsolete by technology. </h3>

    <h3 class="words">Above is a photo taken at an elevation of approximately 13,000ft from the former ski resort located on Chacaltaya. Climate change started melting the snow around the resort in the Mid-1990s. My 2009 all that remained was sharp rocks and a lonely man who still runs the resort atop the dead mountain. </h3>
