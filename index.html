    <p>There is something truly unique about film. The finality of the medium over digital photography adds an element of permanence to the simple act of taking a photo.
      What follows are a series of landscapes,  focusing on decay,  isolation and abandonment made all the more real by the obsolete medium that captured it. 
      Above is a photo from the room where I stayed during my time in Jupapina, Bolivia. At the crest of the mountain is Muela Del Diablo.

      <p>Shot on a disposable camera in around Bolivia in the Summer of 2018, the film inside expired sometime in the early 2000s which I felt would almost transport one back in time. 
          Above is a Jeep that I found while exploring Coroico. 
          A local informed me that his grandfather parked it there sometime in the early 1980s.

      <p>One of the most enjoyable things while shooting on expired film was not knowing if it would even work. 
      This camera had been tucked away in a drawer in a office, forgotten, rendered obsolete by technology.

      <p>Above is a photo of the small village we were staying. 
          Little did I know, my wife and I were hiking towards the villages main water source, a waterfall leading from the Andes Mountains. The path was lined with banana trees.

      <p>Above is a photo taken at an elevation of approx. 13,000ft (3,962m) from the former ski resort located on Chacaltaya. 
          Climate change started melting the snow around the resort in the Mid-1990s. 
          By 2009 all that remained were sharp rocks and a lonely man still attempting to run a resort atop the dead mountain.
